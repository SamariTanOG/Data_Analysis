# Data_Analysis
**Repository Description for Intel Unnati Data Analysis Project**

Welcome to the Data_Analysis repository! This repository houses SQL codes for filtering and sorting data for each vehicle, along with their respective visualizations, organized neatly in dedicated folders.

**Contents:**
- **Vehicle Data:** Find SQL codes to filter and sort data for each vehicle, along with visualization scripts in dedicated folders.

- **Mapping Data:** We utilized tools like ArcGIS and PowerBI to create maps displaying coordinates and dark spots/geohotspots related to various alerts.

- **Driver Behavior:** In this dedicated folder, you'll discover datasets containing error sets with alerts exceeding 50kmph.

**Technologies Used:**
- **PowerBI:** We harnessed the power of PowerBI for dynamic and interactive data visualization.

- **SQL Embedded in Python:** Our data analysis leveraged SQL embedded within Python for efficient data manipulation and querying.

- **ArcGIS Tools:** ArcGIS tools played a pivotal role in mapping and geospatial analysis, allowing us to pinpoint coordinates and identify geohotspots.

**About this Project:**
This dataset was generously provided by Intel for the first round event of Intel Unnati. Our primary objective was to conduct a comprehensive data analysis and generate an insightful report. You can access the full report, complete with findings and insights derived from this repository, by following the link provided in the report.

Thank you for evaluating our work, and please feel free to explore the repository and report for a deeper understanding of our analysis. Your feedback and insights are greatly appreciated.
